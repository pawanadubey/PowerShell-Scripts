Zip files are used to compress multiple files, thatâ€™s why sometimes called "archives".  ZIP files allow easy and managed storage of associated files also fast and efficient transport via e-mail, downloading or sharing through the central share folders.

If your organization does not allow to install any third party application to enzip files, then it becomes a tedious job to manage and share your files. In those cases you can use this PowerShell tool. It does not require anything to download or to install. Just run it.

Note: Sometimes the GUI gets in the background, so please check background if you can't see anything in foreground other than PowerShell console.
